Each vaccine is it's own "definition". This allows it to be modified if CDC regulations change.

Input and Return
___

Takes in Obj:
{
    birthdate: Date,
    vaccinationDates: [Date, ...],
    options: Object
}

birthdate: A Date. The date of birth of the patient.
vaccinationDates: Array of dates of vaccination. Can be empty in case of no vaccination.
options: pass in type of vaccine for the ones that have multiple paths. This can be optional.

Returns object:
{
    vaccinationSchedule: [{Dose Information}, ...],
    messages: {Strings, ...}
}

vaccinationSchedule: An array of objects of the form
    {
        dose: Int, (order of dose),
        date: Date, (date of dose, or proposed date of dose),
        reccommendedDate: Date, (dictated by vaccine settings),
        received: Boolean, (Did patient receive this dose already?),
        ageReceived: Date, (If received, Calculate ageReceived, null if not received),
        interval: Date, (Time delta since previous dose, if any. If no previous dose and is dose1, default to time delta since birthdate. Null if not given.),
        minInterval: Date, (Time delta, min accepted value for interval, declared by specific functions, min age for dose1 is it's minInterval)
        late: Boolean, (If it's late per the schedule),
        early: Boolean, (If it's too early, before min age or inside min interval, (technically equiv?)),
        required: Boolean, (Default true, If not required, set to false, per CDC guideline)
        notes: String, (Any notes, messages regarding this particular dose)
    },
messages: any error flags, notices for entire vaccine. Notes may go here.

It can return a complete array of all doses, to display future/needed doses.

?Return class object via constructor.?
    - Might not be neccesary, we can figure out later

General Flow
___

Preprocessing (can be done inside specific function to receive info such as rec dates):
- Take in the obj, Preprocessing can expand the object to pass into the specific functions
- Set Age = (Now - birthdate)
- Set Doses received = Length of date array
- Makes sure the dates in the vaccinationDates array are sorted
- Makes sure the birthdate and dose dates make sense (return an error of it doesn't)
    - i.e. DOB after a date of vaccination.
    - this can be guarded against during the data input from the front end.
- Parse date array (if any, case of no vaccination, e.g.) into vaccinationSchedule object.
    - Map array to array of objects
    - Set Received flag for given doses
    - Calculate based on current, birth and declared dates
    - Calculate intervals for received doses
    - Declare messages or notes for all doses
- Parse vaccinationSchedule array in specific function per vaccine (see below)
- Pack any messages and objects and returns.

-- specific functions for each vaccine 
-- each vaccine can have it's own settings, like time series for CDC rec doses

Each one will
- If next dose is overdue and min interval passes
    - set date as current date
        - Successive doses can be based off that date
    - notate in messages
    - raise late flag
- Declare dates for unreceived doses, based on their respective dose series
- (Run specific functions)
- After running specific functions:
    - Compare intervals and minIntervals and raise early flags if needed
    - Finalize everything before returning

-? we can check if any is given at all, if none, we can return the recommended schedule based on vaccine settings
    -? This can include a fallback schedule, start today etc.
    - Sounds good.


-? Check for holes in some of the larger conditions like HiB 59.5M, 11.5M etc
